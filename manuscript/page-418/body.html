<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Couldn’t eat a morsel here. Fellow sharpening knife and fork to eat all before him, old chap picking his tootles. Slight spasm, full, chewing the cud. Before and after. Grace after meals. Look on this picture then on that. Scoffing up stewgravy with sopping sippets of bread. Lick it off the plate, man! Get out of this.</p><p>He gazed round the stooled and tabled eaters, tightening the wings of his nose.</p><p>—Two stouts here.</p><p>—One corned and cabbage.</p><p>That fellow ramming a knifeful of cabbage down as if his life depended on it. Good stroke. Give me the fidgets to look. Safer to eat from his three hands. Tear it limb from limb. Second nature to him. Born with a silver knife in his mouth. That’s witty, I think. Or no. Silver means born rich. Born with a knife. But then the allusion is lost.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">An illgirt server gathered sticky clattering plates.</p></div> </div>
