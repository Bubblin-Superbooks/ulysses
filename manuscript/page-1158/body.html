Spooks.</p><p>A VOICE: O rocks.</p><p>PADDY DIGNAM: <em>(Earnestly.)</em> Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor’s Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. How is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. <em>(He looks round him.)</em> A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn’t agree with me.</p><p><em>(The portly figure of John O’Connell, caretaker, stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toadbellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)</em></p><p>FATHER COFFEY: <em>(Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.)</em> Namine. Jacobs. Vobiscuits. Amen.</p></div> </div>
