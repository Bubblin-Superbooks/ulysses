That orangeflower water is so fresh. Nice smell these soaps have. Pure curd soap. Time to get a bath round the corner. Hammam. Turkish. Massage. Dirt gets rolled up in your navel. Nicer if a nice girl did it. Also I think I. Yes I. Do it in the bath. Curious longing I. Water to water. Combine business with pleasure. Pity no time for massage. Feel fresh then all the day. Funeral be rather glum.</p><p>—Yes, sir, the chemist said. That was two and nine. Have you brought a bottle?</p><p>—No, Mr Bloom said. Make it up, please. I’ll call later in the day and I’ll take one of these soaps. How much are they?</p><p>—Fourpence, sir.</p><p>Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. Sweet lemony wax.</p></div> </div>
