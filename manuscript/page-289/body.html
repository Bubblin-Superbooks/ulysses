<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">world again. Enough of this place. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last time I was here was Mrs Sinicoâ€™s funeral. Poor papa too. The love that kills. And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores. Give you the creeps after a bit. I will appear to you after death. You will see my ghost after death. My ghost will haunt you after death. There is another world after death named hell. I do not like that other world she wrote. No more do I. Plenty to see and hear and feel yet. Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their maggoty beds. They are not going to get me this innings. Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.</p><p>Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Solicitor, I think.
