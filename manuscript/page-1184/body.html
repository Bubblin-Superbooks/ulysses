New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses. Compulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and night. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal language with universal brotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers and dropsical impostors. Free money, free rent, free love and a free lay church in a free lay state.</p><p>Oâ€™MADDEN BURKE: Free fox in a free henroost.</p><p>DAVY BYRNE: <em>(Yawning.)</em> Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!</p></div> </div>
