The word known to all men.</p><p>THE MOTHER: Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is allpowerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual and forty days’ indulgence. Repent, Stephen.</p><p>STEPHEN: The ghoul! Hyena!</p><p>THE MOTHER: I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brainwork. Years and years I loved you, O, my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.</p><p>ZOE: <em>(Fanning herself with the grate fan.)</em> I’m melting!</p><p>FLORRY: <em>(Points to Stephen.)</em> Look! He’s white.</p><p>BLOOM: <em>(Goes to the window to open it more.)</em> Giddy.</p></div> </div>
