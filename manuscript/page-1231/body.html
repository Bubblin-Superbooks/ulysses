He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacob’s pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour’s face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)</em></p><p>HENRY: <em>(In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.)</em> There is a flower that bloometh.</p><p><em>(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe’s neck. Henry gallant turns with pendant dewlap to the piano.)</em></p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">STEPHEN: <em>(To himself.)</em> Play with your eyes shut.</p></div> </div>
